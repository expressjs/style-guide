#### Issue Labels

This folder contains a json file that manages the issue labels for the jshttp organization.

It is applied to our repos via [org-labels](https://github.com/repo-utils/org-labels).

```bash
$ org-labels standardize jshttp style-guide
```

If you wish to use this for your own repos, use:

```bash
$ org-labels standardize username{/optional repo} jshttp/style-guide
```
